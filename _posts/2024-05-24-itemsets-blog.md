> “We are drowning in information but starved for knowledge.” - John Naisbitt (1982)


## Introduction

Thanks to the explosive growth of data, data mining has grown as a specialized discipline of data analytics and machine learning. It is estimated that by 2025 ~100 zettabytes of data will be
generated worldwide. For context, 1 zettabyte is the equivalent of 1 trillion terabytes and 1e+12 gigabytes.


Four-Dimensions of Data Mining
- Data to be mined (Input)
- Knowledge to be discovered (Output)
- Techniques utilized (Connects Input-Output)
- Applications adopted (Where to use?)


## Introduction to Data Mining

- “Knowledge Discovery from Data”
- Extraction of interesting patterns or knowledge from huge amounts of data.
- Jiawei Han: Extraction of interesting (non-trivial, implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful) patterns or knowledge from huge amounts of data.
