4. Can we accurately forecast the number of sunspots on the sun?
4. Apply ensemble learning and deep learning methods, such as Extra tree, LSTM, and transformer etc., to predict the sunspot number and Heliospheric current sheet (HCS) indexes and to provide implications for the solar wind global structure in the future.





## [Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations](https://www.sidc.be/SILSO/infosnmtot)
Monthly mean total sunspot number: This dataset contains monthly mean total sunspot numbers, which are averages derived from daily total counts per calendar month, starting from January 1749 up to the last elapsed month. This extensive time range is due to data availability only from 1749 onward because of sparse earlier observations. The dataset is available in plain ASCII text and CSV formats, detailing columns for the year, month, date in fraction of year, monthly mean sunspot number, monthly standard deviation, and number of observations used. Notably, an error value of -1 indicates missing observations, with the monthly standard deviation calculated from daily values. These monthly mean values provide critical insights into long-term solar activity patterns essential for various scientific and operational purposes.

## Heliospheric Current Sheet (HCS) Indexes
Curated by Dr. Liang Zhao from the University of Michigan, this dataset encompasses heliospheric current attributes recorded bi-monthly from 1976 to 2022. The key features of this dataset include the SD index and the SL index. The SD index describes the standard deviation of the HCS's latitude, while the SL index describes the HCS's integrated slope. These novel, derived parameters simplify current methods of evaluating HCS activity and tracking the solar cycle. In compliance with non-disclosure agreements, sharing this dataset with the public is restricted.
