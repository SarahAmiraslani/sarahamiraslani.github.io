  title: Drawing to Learn Abstractions
  description: This project examines the effectiveness of student-generated drawings in
    learning abstract science concepts. By comparing various visualization
    strategies and important covariates in a lab setting, we explore how
    different methods impact retention and understanding of complex topics like
    black holes.
  technologies:
    - Experimental Design
    - Multivariate Analysis
    - General Linear Models

  title: Predicting Sunspot Activity with Machine Learning
  description: This project aims to accurately forecast the number of sunspots on the Sun
    by applying ensemble learning and deep learning methods, including Extra
    Trees, LSTM, and Transformers, to predict sunspot numbers and Heliospheric
    Current Sheet (HCS) indexes. The findings from these models will provide
    insights into the future global structure of the solar wind and its
    implications.
