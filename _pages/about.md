Hello! I'm Sarah, a data scientist with a strong curiosity, a passion for learning, and desire to solve complex problems.

My interdisciplinary background in neuroscience and data science has taught me strong analytical skills and has refined my capacity for dissecting intricate systems - be they biological or technological.

Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of applying my skills across a diverse range of fields, from academic research to manufacturing, banking, and artificial intelligence technology. Each experience has been a valuable learning opportunity, allowing me to collaborate with talented individuals and expand my expertise.

I'm always happy to connect with fellow professionals in related fields. If you're passionate about data science, technology, or related topics, I'd love to chat.
