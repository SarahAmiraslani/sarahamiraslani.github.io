Hello! I'm Sarah, a data professional with a passion for learning and a desire to solve challenging problems.

I have 5+ years of experience working in data analytics across diverse industries including manufacturing automation, quantitative modeling, AI model development, and academic research. I am currently working on building data engineering pipelines to support NVIDIA [NeMo](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/nemo/) products for generative AI.

Iâ€™m passionate about learning from others and mentoring. If you're interested in exchanging ideas or exploring potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out.
