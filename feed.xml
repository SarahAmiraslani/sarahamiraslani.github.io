The show originally aired on AMC from January 20, 2008 to September 29, 2013 and consists of five seasons with a total of 62 episodes. The plot revolves around Walter White, a seemingly unremarkable high school chemistry teacher whose life takes a dramatic turn when he is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Facing his mortality, Walter dives into the world of methamphetamine production, driven by a desperate need to secure his family’s financial future. As Walter’s transformation from a mild-mannered teacher to a ruthless criminal mastermind unfolds, Breaking Bad explores themes of morality, desperation, greed, and the human psyche. Its exceptional storytelling, unforgettable characters, and profound thematic depth have solidified its status as a cultural phenomenon and a pillar of television history.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/BB_-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/BB_-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/BB_-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/BB_.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 same-height" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/walter-white-cash-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/walter-white-cash-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/walter-white-cash-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/walter-white-cash.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 same-height" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> (left) An illustration of the show's main characters.

The connections between Walter, his family, his partner Jesse Pinkman, and the various allies and adversaries they encounter form a intricate web that evolves throughout the series.In this blog post, I’ll be taking a unique approach to analyzing these relationships. Using network analysis techniques, I aim to visualize and explore the connections between characters, potentially revealing patterns that might not be immediately obvious when watching the series. Whether you’re a longtime fan of “Breaking Bad” or new to the show, this analysis aims to provide an interesting perspective on what makes the series so compelling.</p> <h1 id="data-sourcing">Data Sourcing</h1> <h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2> <p>To model the relationships between characters in the Breaking Bad series, we need a reliable source of dialogue between characters. Wikiquote, an open-source, community-led project, provides an extensive collection of quotes contributed by fans. While it may not be exhaustive, it offers a sufficient dataset for our exploratory purposes. Fortunately, there is a dedicated <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad">page</a> for the Breaking Bad franchise.</p> <p>To extract quotes data from Wikiquote, there are a few methods available. One option is to use a web-scraping tool to iterate through each Wikiquote page related to the Breaking Bad franchise and scrape the text. However, a more efficient approach is to utilize the publicly available and regularly updated data dumps provided by the Wikimedia organization. These dumps are updated at least monthly, making them a reliable source<d-footnote>Learn more about the data dumps at https://dumps.wikimedia.org/</d-footnote>. By requesting the XML files for the pages related to Breaking Bad, we can process the text without scraping. This method is ideal because the show’s finale aired nearly a decade ago, so the most recent data dumps should closely match the current live information, making real-time updates unnecessary.</p> <p>The following commands were used to download the latest Wikiquote articles to my machine.</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>wget https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwikiquote/latest/enwikiquote-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2
bzip2 <span class="nt">-d</span> enwikiquote-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2
</code></pre></div></div> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Wget</code> is a command-line tool that makes it possible to download the latest zipped xml data dump from the internet directly to your active directory. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bzip2 -d</code> allows us to decompress the XML file which is necessary to process this unstructured dataset into a semistructured or tabular form. The result is a large XML file that contains all of the Wikiquote article contents per the date of the dump (mine was last updated on 20-Jul-2024 18:02).</p> <h1 id="data-processing">Data Processing</h1> <p>Several developers have created utilities to facilitate this process, and I will be using one such tool: <a href="https://github.com/heyseth/wickedQuotes">wickedQuotes by heyseth</a>. This utility simplifies the extraction and processing of quotes from the data dump, allowing us to focus on analyzing the interactions and relationships between the characters in Breaking Bad.</p> <p>While some quotes are “one-liners” by a single character, I am interested in interactions between characters. My goal is to have a visualization that allows us to compare which seasons/episodes/characters had the most quoted conversations. Ideally, we’d also like to know if a certain character had many conversations in one episode and fewer in others? Were there any outlier episodes with lots of conversations? Was there one season with many conversations? All these domain tasks map neatly to abstract problems of hierarchical data. Hierarchical visualization techniques will be a reasonable solution given these questions.</p>]]></content><author><name>Sarah Amiraslani</name></author><category term="exploration"/><category term="data-visualization"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Visualizing character relations]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Network Analysis of the Star Wars Films</title><link href="https://sarahamiraslani.github.io/blog/2024/starwars-network/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Network Analysis of the Star Wars Films"/><published>2024-06-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://sarahamiraslani.github.io/blog/2024/starwars-network</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sarahamiraslani.github.io/blog/2024/starwars-network/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1> <p>Networks are structures of interconnected elements that offer a powerful lens for understanding complex systems across diverse disciplines. These intricate webs of relationships reveal patterns and behaviors that span from the microscopic to the societal. In the realm of physical sciences, network models illuminate the spread of diseases, showing how pathogens traverse populations. Within medicine, neural networks map the brain’s intricate connections, shedding light on cognition and behavior. In social contexts, networks capture the dynamics of human interaction revealing patterns of influence, communication, and collaboration. These insights unveil how ideas propagate and social movements emerge. Network science, the study of these interconnected structures, has emerged as a versatile tool. It enables researchers to uncover hidden patterns, predict complex behaviors, and design more efficient and resilient systems. Whether modeling disease outbreaks, understanding social dynamics, or optimizing infrastructure, network science provides a framework for unraveling the complexities of our interconnected world.</p> <p>A network is a structure composed of interconnected nodes or elements, where the relationships between these nodes form intricate and often dynamic patterns<d-cite key="easley2010networks"></d-cite>. These patterns can be observed and analyzed across a vast spectrum of disciplines, ranging from the tangible physical sciences and and medicine to the complex interplay of human relationships within social networks.</p> <p>In the physical sciences, networks can model the spread of infectious diseases, illustrating how pathogens navigate through populations <d-cite key="pinheiro2021using"></d-cite>. Similarly, in medicine, networks can map neural connections within the brain, illuminating the pathways of thought and behavior <d-cite key="lumaca2022network"></d-cite>. In social contexts, networks can represent relationships between individuals, organizations, or even entire societies. These networks can reveal patterns of influence, communication, and collaboration, providing insights into the dynamics of social interaction and the spread of ideas <d-cite key="freeman2004development"></d-cite>.</p> <p>The study of networks, often referred to as network science, has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding complex systems across various domains. By analyzing the structure and dynamics of networks, researchers can uncover hidden patterns, predict emergent behaviors, and design more efficient and resilient systems.</p> <h2 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts</h2> <h2 id="structure">Structure</h2> <h2 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h2> <p>In network analysis, a fundamental question is whether every node within a network can reach every other node by traversing its edges. A network is considered connected if a path exists between any two nodes.</p> <p>A network that is not connected can be divided into distinct, self-contained groups of nodes called connected components. Each connected component represents a subset of the network where every node within the component has a path to every other node within the component, but this property does not hold true for a larger set of nodes (i.e., not fully connected to a larger piece of the graph).</p> <p>Dividing a network into it’s components is a global way of describing it’s structure. Within a given component, there may be more informative internal structure that is important to understanding the network.</p> <h2 id="distance">Distance</h2> <p>Beyond simple connectivity, it’s often more informative to quantify the distance between nodes. For example, in the spread of news or diseases, understanding how many “hops” information or contagion must take to travel between individuals is vital.</p> <p>The distance between two nodes is defined as the length of the shortest path between them, where each step along a path represents a connection between nodes. We can then characterize the distance between all pairs of nodes in a graph by looking at the average distance between every pair of nodes in the network or the maximum distance between any pair of nodes.</p> <p><strong>Breadth-first search</strong> (BFS) is a common algorithm used to efficiently find shortest paths in networks. The algorithm is as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Find all distances to a seed node.</li> <li>Find all connections to the seed node and declare them to be at distance 1.</li> <li>For each node found in step 1, find all their connections which were not previously found, and declare them to be at distance 2.</li> <li>Continue discovering new nodes in layers with each new layer adding one to the distance.</li> </ol> <div class="row equal-height"> <div class="col-md-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <div class="content"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/network-example-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/network-example-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/network-example-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/network-example.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <div class="content"> <table class="table"> <thead> <tr> <th>Distance</th> <th>Nodes</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>K, B</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>C</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>E, F</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>H, I, D, G</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>J</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </div> </div> <h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1> <p>In this blog post, I will delve into the field of network analysis and use it to uncover patterns and insights within the social networks of the Star Wars universe. By analyzing data on character interactions across the Star Wars saga, I will introduce the fundamentals of network analysis, including identifying key influencers and communities and understanding the flow of information and power.</p> <h1 id="data-source">Data Source</h1> <p>The network data we’ll be using for this analysis is based on the work of Evelina Gabasova. She extracted interactions between characters from the scripts of Star Wars Episodes I through VII. The network is defined by characters who speak to each other within the same scene where the nodes are the characters and the edges represent their communication. The network is undirected and the edges are weighted by the number of interactions between the characters.</p> <p>You can find the code used to create the network on <a href="https://github.com/evelinag/star-wars-network-data">GitHub</a> and download the data itself from <a href="https://github.com/evelinag/star-wars-network-data">Kaggle</a> <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite>.</p> <h1 id="key-concepts-1">Key Concepts</h1> <div class="row d-flex align-items-stretch"> <div class="col-md-6 mt-3 mt-md-0 d-flex"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/network-example-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/network-example-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/network-example-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/network-example.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-md-6 mt-3 mt-md-0 d-flex"> <div class="flex-fill"> <table class="table"> <thead> <tr> <th>Distance</th> <th>Nodes</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>K, B</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>C</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>E, F</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>H, I, D, G</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>J</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </div> </div> <h2 id="degree-distributions">Degree Distributions</h2> <p>The degree of a node in an undirected graph is the number of neighbors it has.</p>]]></content><author><name>Sarah Amiraslani</name></author><category term="exploration"/><category term="network-analysis"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This blog post explores the fundamentals of network analysis using the Star Wars character interactions.]]></summary></entry></feed>
